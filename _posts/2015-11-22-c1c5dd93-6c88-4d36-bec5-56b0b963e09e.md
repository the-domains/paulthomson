The Genius of Charles Darwin - Prof Richard Dawkins' three hour journey into the life and work of the great philatelist and the contemporary and modern day reactions to his ground breaking work. This is an eclectic soundtrack ranging from brutal and agressive (Attack in the Trees) to wistful and melancholic (insert title).. A wonderful project to score for RDF, and one which I am immensely proud of.
