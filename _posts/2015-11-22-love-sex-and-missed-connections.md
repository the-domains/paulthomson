This fantastic feature film was written by Kenny Stevenson and directed by Eric Kissack and is a wonderful comedic romance with a unique twist. A real ensemble treat with many of Kenny's friends from The Groundlings in LA, the film is winning awards all over the place - 9 International Film Festival awards so far! I had a blast working with the team, and got to play lots of real instruments myself on the score.
